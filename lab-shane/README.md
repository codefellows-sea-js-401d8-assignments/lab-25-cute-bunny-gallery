# Lab 25 Bunny Display Widgets

This project utilizes custom directives to show internet memes.  From the home page, three meme galleries are presented from which to choose.  Upon selection, there is a list of links for each gallery.  Additionally, are toggles to switch between thumbnail and list view.  Each list/thumbnail item will link to a full size image of that meme.

## Launch

To launch the project, in the command line, run `npm run watch`, then point a web browser to http://localhost:8080
